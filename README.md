# FakeBlueScreen
  FakeBlueScreen is a fake BSOD Window for windows systems coded in 
Java. This program simulates the window when a BSOD occured in a machine. 
When ran, a window will show with a blue backdrop and texts saying that 
a BSOD has occured. No other applications will permanently be on top when 
this application is running.
	There are two ways to terminate the program. The first is the three 
lock combination hard coded in the program: F4 + F8 + F12. This program 
can also be terminated through system restart and forced shutdown. Please 
use with caution.
	You may need Java Runtime Environment to run these files.
