	You will need "javac" to compile the source. "javac" is
packaged with JDK. You can get JDK here: 

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

	Add "javac" to the environment variable. Go to the directory
of the sources and type "javac Main.java UserInterface.java". Wait
for the prompt to finish.

	If you want to package classes on an executable JAR file, 
open console, then navigate to the source folder. Make sure that
you installed and added Java Development Kit to the path. Type:
"jar cfe FakeBSOD.jar Main Main.class UserInterface.class"
